// Variable - Most basic building block
// Variables - Store, access, modify === value
// Declare, assignment operator, assign value
// assign value later, modify existing
// can contain digits, letters, underscore, $
// must start with a letter, $ or _

// cannot use keywords as variables
// cannot start with a number

// case sensitive - fullname vs Fullname

// camelCase or underscore (full_name)

// using const (CONSTANT) - can't be reassigned
// cannot assign a const without a value as you can with let

let name = "norm";
let address, zip, state, city;
address = "101 main street"
zip = "76777"
city = "Saginaw"
state = "MI"
console.log(name, address, city, state, zip)
